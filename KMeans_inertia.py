	Finds the likely number of image groups (clusters) "k" among the input images.
	The most likely k to use for the sorting is located at the "knee" of the K-Means inertia graph,
	where the graph is flattening out (at the bottom). The lower the inertia, the tighter the groups
	will be. However, the trade-off will be more clusters. No data scaling is performed.
